## Game Detail

The game builds a deck of 16 cards that are shuffled. It compares each 2 cards flipped over for a match. If matched, the cards turn green and stay faceup. If not matched, the cards turn red and flip back over.

When all 16 cards are matched and faceup, the game is won and winning message is displayed. The winning message details the number of moves, star rating, and overall time for the game.

Reset button will restart the whole game.
